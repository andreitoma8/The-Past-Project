# The Past Project
### The Past Project's ecosystem of Smart Contracts: ERC20 $PAST token, ERC721 Gems of the Past Collection, ERC20 and ERC721 Staking.

## ERC20 Staking SC:

- Stake $PAST Token
- Earn 21.56 % APR on their deposit
- Compound the rewards once 24h to get to 24% APY
- Claim the rewards to their wallet
- Withdraw a specified amount of $PAST from their stake. On withdrawal, the user activates a cooldown timer of 24h until he can make another deposit. This is built to address a workaround where users can withdraw and stake again to compound more frequently than daily.
- Claim a NFT reward if they had staked more than 1 billion $PAST for the last 30 days. User has to still have more than 1 billion $PAST staked at the moment of claim, it is recommended he only withdraws his tokens after he claimed the NFT.


## ERC721 Staking:

- Stake a maximum amount of 1 NFT per color and a maximum of 11 NFTs in total.
- Users will start earning rewards when he has at least 3 NFTs staked. For every new threshold(3,5,7,11) he will have a specific allocation of PAST (See FAQ)
- Claim the rewards they accumulated.
- Withdraw NFTs
